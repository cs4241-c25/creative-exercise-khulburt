- SVG: Go through the [W3 Schools SVG Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp).

Create a button that when pressed changes either the size and/or position of a polygon. See [SVG Scripting](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp).
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp, other pages within that website, and backend code from my other homework assignments.
- I changed the colors, and positions of all polygons. I also added points to some of them.
